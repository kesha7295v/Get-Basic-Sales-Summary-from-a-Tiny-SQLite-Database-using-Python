# Get-Basic-Sales-Summary-from-a-Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python
Use SQL inside Python to pull simple sales info (like total quantity sold, total revenue), and  display it using basic print statements and a simple bar chart.
This project demonstrates a simple sales data analysis using SQLite, Python, and Matplotlib. A sample pizza sales CSV file is loaded into a SQLite database (sales_data.db) and analyzed using SQL queries executed through Python. The project includes a script that connects to the database, inserts data into a sales table, and visualizes the results using bar charts. Key insights such as total revenue per pizza and revenue by category are displayed. This project is ideal for beginners looking to learn data integration, SQL querying, and basic data visualization in Python. Charts are saved as PNG files for reference.
